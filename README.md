This repo contains my solutions for some challenges on Codewars along with the tests that were provided. The dependencies are equivalent to the ones used by Codewars for TypeScript:

-   TypeScript 3.3
-   Mocha 5.2.0
-   Chai 4.2.0

## Challenges

Here's a list of all the challenges I've done (and documented).

Adds up multiple letters together. If the sum is bigger than 'z', the letters will overflow back to 'a'.
